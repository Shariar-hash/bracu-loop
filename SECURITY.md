# 🔒 Security Guide for BRACU Loop Project

## Critical Security Measures Implemented

### 🛡️ Environment Variables Protection
- All `.env*` files are excluded from git tracking
- API keys and secrets are never committed to the repository
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables

### 🔑 Required Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

### 🚫 Files Excluded from Git (Security)
- `.env` - Contains actual API keys
- `*.env` - All environment files
- Database SQL files with sensitive data
- Debug and fix scripts
- Any files containing secrets, keys, tokens, or credentials

### ⚠️ Security Reminders
1. **Never commit API keys or passwords**
2. **Always use environment variables for sensitive data**
3. **Regularly rotate API keys**
4. **Use different keys for development and production**
5. **Review commits before pushing to ensure no secrets are included**

### 🔍 Before Pushing to GitHub
Always run these checks:
```bash
# Check what files will be committed
git status

# Review changes to ensure no secrets are included
git diff --staged

# Look for potentially sensitive content
git grep -i "api.*key\|secret\|password" --staged
```

### 🌐 Supabase Security Settings
- Row Level Security (RLS) should be enabled in production
- Use service role key only on server-side operations
- Public anon key is safe for client-side use
- Configure proper database policies

### 📋 Security Checklist
- [x] .gitignore properly configured
- [x] .env file excluded from git
- [x] .env.example provided as template
- [x] No hardcoded API keys in source code
- [x] Sensitive SQL files excluded
- [ ] Set up environment variables in deployment platform
- [ ] Enable RLS policies in production
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings
- [ ] Set up monitoring for suspicious activities

## 🚨 Emergency Security Response
If you accidentally commit sensitive data:
1. **Immediately rotate/regenerate all exposed keys**
2. **Remove sensitive data from git history**: `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo`
3. **Force push the cleaned history**: `git push --force-with-lease`
4. **Update all deployment environments with new keys**

## 📞 Support
If you need help with security setup, contact the development team or create an issue in the repository.
